# Description
 ** Your task is create a card game (war) using OOP concepts that you've learnt, the game has different types of variants when it comes to rules. However, mvp would be: there are 2 players to play the game, cards divided evenly (10-12 etc), each player reveals the card deck, whose card is higher value, then that player collects both cards, if both are equal then they reveal another cards (which leads to "war/battle" as name of the game says), it continues until one of them has got higher card deck, if one of the player runs out of a card, then he loses the game**


## Technical Requirements

1. Make the program use `OOP` concepts
2. In MVP version , only 2 players can play
3. Cards should be divided evenly for all players
4. Cards values are assigned randomly
5. The game also will be played with random cards (chaotic, no prediction)
6. The game should be played with 10 cards max initially (in version 0.0.1)
7. Each player reveals their card, who got higher card value, collects the opponent card
8. If both cards are equal, then they reveal another card, which leads to "war/battle"
9. The game continues until one of them has got higher card deck
10. If one of the player runs out of a card, then he loses the game
11. Think of edge cases which wasn't mentioned here (e.g user-friendly messages, exceptions, etc)


### Consistency on using git and github is mandatory
